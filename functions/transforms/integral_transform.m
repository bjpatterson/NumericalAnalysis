function [x, u_x] = integral_transform (v_y, K_xy, degree, n, eps = 0)
# A stepping stone towards general integral transform
#
# numerically solves for u(x) such that
#   'v(y) = integral( K(x,y)u(x)dx )'; x,y on [0,1]
#
# INPUTS:
#   v_y: a univariate anonymous function (defined on [0,1])
#   K_xy: an anonymous kernel function in two variables (x,y), defined on x,y from [0,1]
#   degree: estimation degree to use (0-2 supported)
#   n: number of intervals on x and y to use in estimation
#   eps: the theshold for ignoring near-zero elements (may speed up calculations)
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   x: a vector of the x values for which u(x) has been numerically solved
#   u_x: the numeric approximation of u(x).  u_x(n) ~ u(x(n))
#
# USAGE:
#   integral_transform(@(y)y*(y-1), @(x,y)exp(-10*abs(x-y)), 1, 64)
